/* ex03.c
 * PLOT:
 *   Walk an array with pointer arithmetic. Compute distance between two pointers.
 *   Demonstrate one-past-the-end (without dereferencing).
 *
 * STORY POINTS:
 *   [SP-1] Create int a[5] = {0,1,2,3,4}, get int *p = a.
 *   [SP-2] Print *(p+i) using pointer arithmetic only.
 *   [SP-3] Compute (a+5) - (a) and print it (expect 5).
 *   [SP-4] Get a pointer one past the last element & show it's legal to compare but illegal to dereference.
 *
 * HINTS:
 *   - ยง3 Pointer arithmetic
 *   - ยง25 One past end
